# Yuni
Yuni is a remake of Cove which was the server core used by HCR. This is an early version of the project and does not represent the final product.

## Warning
This core is unfinished and untested. This core is not meant to be put into production until its fully completed. Any and all issues you encounter will have to be fixed by you or another third party developer.
Please do not create issues within GitHub as they will most likely be ignored. This may change as the core comes closer to completion.

## Dependencies
The only dependency required is a supported database. As of version `1.0-SNAPSHOT` the only supported database is `MongoDB`.
